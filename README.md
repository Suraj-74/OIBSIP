# OIBSIP
In this internship, I work as a data science intern in which i have to perform various project...
## The Tasks which i have to perform...
### 1. UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON: 
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
### 2. CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING:
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
### 3. SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON:
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
